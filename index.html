My name is Auday Sawaged and I am currently a senior at the University of Nebraska at Omaha
                and I am studying Management Information Systems. I anticipate on graudating this May of 2019
                contingent of me passing all three of my current classes. I received a jump start in my career
                when OPPD hired me as a IT Analyst. I will be moving to California soon to start my career as a Cyber
                Security Engineer, which I cannot wait for! I am currently 23 years old and live alone. I enjoy being
                outdoors and hanging with friends. I am extremely happy to say I find my work extremely enjoying due to
                the challenges it brings me, I look forward in my life after college and the new opportunities that await
                me!
